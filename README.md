# Scientific Computing Third Year Module

This repo is a log of the code I wrote for the scientific computing module I took during the autumn term of the third year of my physics degree.

I can all but grantee that when I look back over the code in years to come I'll be amazed by how inefficiently I did everything, but I think it's valuable to have around as a record of my development as a programmer.

## First Task: Lunar Lander Game

The first task we've been given is a bit of a coding refresh exercise, focused on using matplotlib's widgets module to make a GUI.
The idea is simple: you've got a lunar lander falling towards the surface of the moon, which you want to slow down to a safe landing speed. To make it more of a challenge, there should be a limited fuel supply which once depleted disables the thrusters.
